    "Tackling is a critical part of every football play. The one goal of the defense is to reach the ball carrier and bring them to the ground. This goal has two parts. First the defender must arrive in the same location as the ball carrier, but once they are there it is still imperitive to complete the tackle. Sometimes the defender is unable to bring the ball carrier to the ground and this is considered a missed tackle. This exploration considers the parts of the tackle and looks for indicators of missed tackles prior to contact."

    "Tackles can be broken down to investigate different parts. First, is the need to reach the same point. Projecting the players direction to calculate the contact point can provide information about the possible contact. Such as the contact angle, the distance to contact, and the momentum of each player at contact. The momentum of each player can be further analyzed by determining the momentum in the x and y directions. Since the offense is attempting to advance the ball the ball carrier's momentum in the positive x direction will provide the most value and the defenders momentum in the negative x direction will be attempting to counter the positive x momentum of the ball carrier."

Momentum is conserved in collisions, so the simplified idea is that ball carriers with more momentum than tacklers could break through the tackle. Therefore, the difference in the ball carrier's momentum and the defender's momentum was calculated. To take this one step further, the momentum was broken down into it's x and y components. This specifies how much of the players momentum is moving toward the endzones (x component) and how much is moving toward the sidelines (y component). "
