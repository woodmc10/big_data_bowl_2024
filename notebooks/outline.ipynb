    "In contact sports like football, momentum is a critical component, and tackling is an excellent example of a sports collision. The [Law of Momentum Conservation](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/hs-physics/x215e29cb31244fa1:forces-and-motion/x215e29cb31244fa1:conservation-of-momentum/a/what-is-conservation-of-momentum)  governs collisions in physics. It states that momentum in a collision cannot be created or lost but must remain the same before and after the event, such as a tackle. Although football is a complex sport in the real world and cannot be fully explained by this single law, the concept of momentum conservation provides an interesting platform to study football tackles. This investigation focuses on deriving actionable insights for both offensive and defensive strategies by analyzing the momentum of the ball carrier and the defender, with the goal of enhancing performance outcomes."

    "Momentum is a concept in physics that describes the motion of an object. It is the product of an object's mass and its velocity, which includes information about the direction. In simple terms, momentum in a tackle scenario can be thought of as the \"driving force\" that both players have due to their mass and speed. The one with greater momentum at the time of collision is likely to have a dominant impact in the tackle."

    "## Data Collection Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The [available tracking data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2024/data) was analyzed to identify the frames of running plays where defenders were positioned approximately 2 yards away from the ball carrier. The distance of 2 yards was chosen to ensure defenders were more than an arms distance away, meaning contact was imminent but had not occured. A small cushion was allowed to account for the frame sampling rate, so defenders between 1.8 and 2.2 yards away from the ball carrier were included in the data set. The tackles group included assists, but forced fumbles were excluded from the analysis because there is no way to know if the defender would have completed the tackle after forcing the ball out. The dataset was further refined by projecting the point of contact between the defender and the ball carrier. If this point was located behind either player or outside the field of play, the data point was removed. Finally, the number of tackles was down sampled to match the number in the missed tackles group."

    "## Raw Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate the impact of tackles, we can analyze the momentum of the ball carriers and defenders separately. In the imagined perfect collision the object with more momentum will continue moving. Considering the ball carrier as one of the objects in the collisions, missed tackles occur when the momentum of the ball carrier is not stopped by the defender. By using a histogram of the ball carrier momentum, we can see that missed tackles occur more frequently when the ball carrier has more momentum. In football, this aligns with intuition, as a ball carrier with more momentum is more likely to break through attempted tackles."

This trend may not be helpful when tackles are considered to be a perfect system, but it aligns with football intuition. An increase in momentum often results in a decrease in control and precision. As a result, defenders may be unable to execute a perfect hit or wrap the ball carrier to bring them down, or they could overcommit to an angle of persuit and miss the ball carrier entirely."

    "## Momentum in the Plane of the Field\n",
    "Momentum is an important aspect of many sports. It is a vector measurement that can be expressed in terms of magnitude and direction. To determine how much momentum is moving towards the scoring endzone versus the sidelines, the components of the momentum are calculated. Positive endzone momentum moves towards the scoring endzone and negative endzone momentum moves away from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Endzone Momentum**\n",
    "\n",
    "When examining the tackling technique, plotting the endzone momentum of the ball carrier against the endzone momentum of the defender provides more detailed information. The plots are separated to distinguish defenders with momentum away from the scoring endzone from defenders with momentum towards the scoring endzone. In both plots the ball carrier's momentum is moving toward the scoring endzone.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the plot with the defender's momentum moving away from the scoring endzone, the trendlines for both successful and missed tackles show a negative correlation. This suggests that defenders more often have higher momentums when they are moving downhill to attempt tackles against ball carriers who have not yet built up speed in their run. The trendlines are not parallel, but instead intersect at approximately 600 yards per second of defender momentum. The crossing trendlines indicate that the significance of ball carrier and defender momentum varies in their contribution to successful and missed tackles depending on which one is higher. Since it is rare for the ball carrier to have a large momentum when the defender has a large momentum moving away from the endzone, these situatations more commonly lead to missed tackles. This could be due to ball carriers making changes in direction or acceleration because they have not yet built up momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a defender's momentum is toward the scoring endzone, the slight positive correlation observed between the defender and ball carrier momentum is even more pronounced. This is reasonable because defenders who trail the ball carrier must match or exceed the speed of the ball carrier in order to catch up with them. The trendlines still demonstrate that higher ball carrier momentum results in more missed tackles, as is seen with the non-directional momentum measures."

One interesting note from this plot, marginal distributions show heavier tails in the missed tackles indicating that missed tackles happen at the extremes of sideline momentum. "

If this square remained in the plane of the field, the markings would always stay vertical and horizontal in this square as the ball carrier runs across different parts of the field. But if this square was anchored to the frame of the ball carrier, the markings would change orientation based on the direction the ball carrier movement. This could be disorienting for viewers, but it can provide valuable information about the defender's movements in relation to the ball carrier."

Whether it is the raw magnitude of momentum, momentum in relation to the field, or momentum in relation to the ball carrier, it is a impactful factor. Evaluating momentum in the plane of the ball carrier, in particular, can help visualize the direction of the defender in relation to the ball carrier without having to plot them separately.\n",

The horizontal line sets the direction of the ball carrier, with the ball carrier's momentum moving to the right. In this plane, it is easier to see that Smith is more likely to miss tackles when his momentum is moving in a very similar direction to that of the ball carrier. When Smith can attack from less acute angles, he is able to complete more of his tackles. With this information, a coach and Smith can investigate his position, movement, and attack angles in these plays and identify opportunities for improvement in Smith's attempted tackles."
