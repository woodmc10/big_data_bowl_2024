    "## Theorize Components of Tackle\n",
    "* Important parts of a tackle:\n",
    "    - Reaching the same place - can’t make a tackle from looking at a ball carrier, must make contact\n",
    "        * speed, direction, angle, persuit\n",
    "        * how far away is the tackler from the ball carrier? (distance)\n",
    "        * if both ball carrier and tackler maintain their direction and speed where will their paths cross? (distance to contact point)\n",
    "        * speed and direction changes\n",
    "            - juking, cutting, throwing on the breaks as techniques for avoiding tackles\n",
    "            - defenders reaction time, ability to adjust to changes\n",
    "    - Force at contact\n",
    "        * when the tackler and the defender meet the force applied through the two players will be impacted by each one's speed, direction, size, etc\n",
    "            - height and weight differential\n",
    "            - angle and speed differential\n",
    "                * same speed, same angle/direction will impart much less force than same speed opposite angle/direction\n",
    "                * defenders will not have much luck making good tackles if they are stationary at the point of contact\n",
    "    - Form (rugby, all of these are from a mostly head on collision type attack angle)\n",
    "        * get low \n",
    "            - contact through the hips of the ball carrier\n",
    "            - cheek to cheek (face to butt)\n",
    "            - pick a side (don't put your head in the middle of the ball carrier's body)\n",
    "            - chop your feet just before contact (the decrease in speed of your lower body and momentum of your upper body helps drop the height of your head and shoulders to improve contact position without losing all your momentum)\n",
    "        * wrap arms around the ball carrier\n",
    "            - front arm around mid section prevents the ball carrier from off loading to a support player\n",
    "            - back arm wraps around back of leg, picking up that leg and driving prevents the ball carrier from continuing to drive their legs and make forward progress\n",
    "        * drive through the ball carrier\n",
    "            - make contact with the ball carrier as if you want to drive them backward into someone 1 yard behind them\n",
    "    - Access\n",
    "        * difficult to tackle the ball carrier if there is a blocker between the defender and the ball carrier"
