11/17
- Theorize Components of Tackle
    * Important parts of a tackle:
        - Reaching the same place - canâ€™t make a tackle from looking at a ball carrier, must make contact
            * speed, direction, angle, persuit
            * how far away is the tackler from the ball carrier? (distance)
            * if both ball carrier and tackler maintain their direction and speed where will their paths cross? (distance to contact point)
            * speed and direction changes
                - juking, cutting, throwing on the breaks as techniques for avoiding tackles
                - defenders reaction time, ability to adjust to changes
        - Force at contact
            * when the tackler and the defender meet the force applied through the two players will be impacted by each one's speed, direction, size, etc
                - height and weight differential
                - angle and speed differential
                    * same speed, same angle/direction will impart much less force than same speed opposite angle/direction
                    * defenders will not have much luck making good tackles if they are stationary at the point of contact
        - Form (rugby, all of these are from a mostly head on collision type attack angle)
            * get low 
                - contact through the hips of the ball carrier
                - cheek to cheek (face to butt)
                - pick a side (don't put your head in the middle of the ball carrier's body)
                - chop your feet just before contact (the decrease in speed of your lower body and momentum of your upper body helps drop the height of your head and shoulders to improve contact position without losing all your momentum)
            * wrap arms around the ball carrier
                - front arm around mid section prevents the ball carrier from off loading to a support player
                - back arm wraps around back of leg, picking up that leg and driving prevents the ball carrier from continuing to drive their legs and make forward progress
            * drive through the ball carrier
                - make contact with the ball carrier as if you want to drive them backward into someone 1 yard behind them
        - Access
            * difficult to tackle the ball carrier if there is a blocker between the defender and the ball carrier

11/24
- Single Frame Metrics
    - make contact metrics
        - ~~tackler distance to ball carrier~~
        - ~~tackler distance to contact point~~
            - using the direction of each player, find the point where they will meet, calculate the distance between the tackler and that point
        - ~~tackler time to contact~~
            - see above calculation
            - use tackler speed to determine time to cover the distance
        - ~~ball carrier time to contact~~
            - see above, but ball carrier
        - ~~difference in time to contact~~
            - find the difference between tackler time to contact and ball carrier time to contact
        - will make contact yes/no
            - set a limit for the difference in time to contact point
            - example: assume reaching the same point 2 seconds appart will result in the tackler not making contact with the ball carrier
                - need to determine how to set the max time difference
    - force metrics
        - ~~tackler force~~
            - total (mass * acceleration)
            - north-south (trigonometry with force and direction)
            - east_west 
            - in direction of contact point (this is the same as the total because the contact point is defined to be in the direction the ball carrier and tackle are traveling)
        - ~~ball carrier force~~
            - total, north-south, east-west
        - ~~force difference~~
            - total, north-south, east-west
            - **adjust total based on angle of contact**
                - reduce the force metric based on the angle of tackler and ball carrier contact
                    - possible calculation: determine the force of the tackler in the direction the ball carrier is moving, compare that to the full force of the ball carrier
    - ~~direction and angle~~
        - difference in direction of movement and orientation
            - normalize using sine
 - other metrics that feel outside of the ability to evaluate from a single frame and may be better if aggregating over mulitple frames (will define later)
    - make contact metrics
        - ball carrier shiftiness
        - tackler adjustments
    - force metrics
        - conservation of momentum
- Code metrics

    * ~~reduce to only running plays~~
    * ~~reduce to only defensive players~~

    * ~~remove plays where the same player misses and makes a tackle~~
- Plot metrics
    * ~~bar plots of each numeric metric~~
    * other plots to try
        - ~~violin plots~~
        - something creative with angle plots
        - search internet for other options
        - get Lisa's ideas
    * two dimensional plots
        - ~~create 2-3 scatter plots with two dimensions~~
        - search the internet for other options
        - get Lisa's ideas
- Create outline of final notebook
- investigate rows where check_y_contact is not matching
- metrics updates
    - what to do with outliers in the make contact metrics?
    - ~~reduce the angles above 360 by subtracting 360~~
    - ~~make a scatter plot of momentum_x and momentum_x_ball_carrier~~
        * ~~try to figure out difference in momentum_x_add and momentum_x_diff~~
            - The values in the scatter plot look more quadratic than linear. Looking at the values it makes sense why the addition shows a different distribution than the subtraction.

- plots
    * ~~absolute value of momentum_y for all "in the plane" momentum plots~~
    * ~~match aspect ratio in momentum_x plot (first plot with lowess curves)~~
    * ~~distribution of distance~~
        - ~~for running plays almost all distances should be ~1 yard~~
- ~~data checks~~
    * ~~math on the plane of the ball carrier~~
        - ~~why is most of the data in the positive x direction? doesn't this indicate the tackler is moving in the same direction as the ball carrier? ~~
            * ~~this is what it indicates, but plotting the histogram of the direction of the tackler shows that most defenders have a direction between 0 and 180 degrees (aka are moving in the direction of the scoring end zone)~~
- ~~deep thinking~~
    * ~~interpret the momentum_x plot (first plot with lowess curves) to understand what the inflection point in the lowess curve indicates~~
        - ~~is it more likely for players to miss tackles when they are moving in the opposite direction that the ball carrier is moving?~~
        - see notebook for drawing and thinking
- ~~weight interpretation~~
    * ~~do the plots indicating speed and weight have an impact on tackles just mean that some positions are less likely to miss tackles?~~
        - ~~line backers' primary role is to make tackles so they are better at making tackles?~~
    * ~~join the position of the defenders into the dataframes~~
        - ~~plot weight v tackles separated by position~~
        - ~~summarize if position is a confounding variable~~
            * there is still some difference visible with the linebackers
- ~~pass plays~~
    * ~~repeat all of plotting with pass plays~~
    * ~~plot distances~~
        - ~~expect to see some plays where the distance is ~1 yard and some plays where the distance is smaller~~
            * ~~smaller distances would indicate the defender is less than 1 yard from the ball carrier when they catch the ball~~
    * repeat plotting but split data into two groups
        - > 1 yard at catch (frameId > 7)
        - < 1 yard at catch (frameId = 7)
    
    
12/22
interesting plots to consider
- hist/violin/box
    * speed
    * orientation and direction
    * momentum (x and y)
        - momentum x is visibly different when comparing running and passing plays (at 2 yards)
    * momentum y ball carrier
        - why is the None type so much more narrowly distributed?
    * contact angle momentum
        - check math again, is this defender momentum?
        - tackles have higher momentum in direction of ball carrier? 
            * trailing tackles?
    * contact angle
        - normalize by adding 360 to all negative contact angles?
    * contact angle momentum y
    * momentum y sum
    * y contact
        - fewer tackles are missed in the middle of the field for pass plays, doesn't apply to run plays (2 yards)
- scatter
    * speed
    * dir
    * momentum
    * momentum y (more correlated than other plots)
- other
    * orientation vs direction
        - run compared to pass
    * momentum x ball carrier vs momentum y abs ball carrier
        - run
            * remove ball carriers with negative momentum x and split plots to have ball carrier with positive momentum y on one plot and ball carrier with negative momentum y on second plot (still plot momentum y abs for both)
                - really think through what it means to need to split this data out. Is there something inherently incorrect about plotting all the data on one plot? Why are most of the defenders moving in the same x direction as the ball carrier? Does this stay consistent in the ball carrier plane plots? Why???? Plot ~20 plays with defender moving in same x direction as ball carrier? (Did the plane get rotated 90 degrees so x direction is really y direction?)
        - run compared to pass
    * momentum x vs momentum x ball carrier lowess
    * weight of linebackers 
        - 250lb bin looks like it makes more tackles and misses less tackles
            * pull out data where defender is between 240 and 250 lbs and look for an explanation
sanity checks
- runs
    * ~~restrict range to 0.8 - 1.2 yards to avoid very small distance outliers~~
- both
    * ~~check <2 yards plots~~
    * ~~visualize rotated plays~~
        - ~~consider impact on y direction metrics~~
- pass
    * ~~visualize a few plays with small distances~~
        - if splitting pass plays for defenders within small distance at time of catch, change code to include frame 6 (pass caught frame) and split dataframe where 'frame == 6' and 'frame != 6'
    * ~~confirm plays are restricted to frames after catch~~

What is the story?
momentum in different planes?
* plane of the field
    - x direction
        * why so many defenders are moving in same x direction as ball carrier
        * separate analysis for momentum_x vs momentum_x_ball_carrier
            - plot x momentum when tackler moving in same direction as ball carrier
            - plot x momentum when tackler moving in opposite direction as ball carrier
            - what to do when momentum_x_ball_carrier is negative?
                * plot separately?
                * remove?
                * normalize both ball carrier and defender values?
        * compare momentum_x between run and pass plays
    - y direction
        * momentum y violin plots
            - missed tackles have a much flatter distribution
                * more tackles are missed (proportionally) when the tackler has lots of momentum in the y direction
                    - can you say more tackles are missed when **MOST** of the tacklers momentum is moving in the y directions?
                * same applies to momentum_y_ball_carrier, but the plots look very different (dip at 0 momentum in defenders but not ball carriers) - what does this mean?
                * what is causing the large y momentum (high momentum or sharp angles)?
                * absolute momentum y - more definition in tails, help tell story
        * momentum_y vs momentum_y_ball_carrier is highly correlated 
            - use this to lead into contact angle stats (plane of the ball carrier)
* plane of the ball carrier
    - contact_angle_momentum_y_abs
        * proportionally more tackles are missed at higher momentums perpendicular to the direction of the ball carrier
    - plot contact_angle_momentum vs contact_angle_momentum_y_abs?

# Convos with Zach
## 11/2
Pressure Probability Notebook:
custom loss function - compute the loss on each frame, only take the frame with the minimum loss to update gradients
this is a complex solution that would probably take me the full 3 months to understand and implement

simplify problem - one frame per play
every play, 0.5 sec before first contact -> this is leaky because it is moving the wrong way in time
first frame where a defender is 3 yards from the runner
**need to come up with the method that can be used for this**

first contact tag - does it tag every player for a single frame? Is the nearest player to the runner labeled as a missed tackle?
Zach imagines first contact will not often/always be a missed tackle

Example of a final goal (insite):
- Investigate defenders setting the edge - is there a situation/scenario/scheme/etc that results in more missed tackles?
